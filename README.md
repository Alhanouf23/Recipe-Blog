# Recipe-Blog: A Cooking Blog Built with Node.js and MongoDB
The Recipe Blog is a web application that allows users to explore recipes, filter them by categories, and search by keyword.
Also,users can view details about each recipe, such as ingredients and preparation steps.
In this app we used MongoDB to store recipes, Node.js and Express.js for backend logic, and EJS for templating.

Technologies Used:
Node.js: Backend server.
Express.js: Handles routing.
MongoDB: Stores recipe data.
EJS: Renders HTML pages dynamically.
Bootstrap: Ensures responsive design.
